                        A recent Scout study carried out by Mediahub found that young people love to re-watch action movies from the
                        past. With that in mind, weâ€™re taking a look at some of the best movies from the decade that put the genre on
                        the map: the 1980s. The following are therefore films that hit big at the time and continue to influence
                        writers, actors, and directors to this day.
